**ReactJS Animation with GSAP**
âœ¨ This project focuses on using GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) in ReactJS to create animations, transitions, and transformations. GSAP offers robust tools for dynamic animations, and by integrating it with ReactJS, we can enhance user interfaces with smooth motion and interactive features.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
